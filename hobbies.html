                        <p class="info">
                            I played Genshin Impact for a while and I enjoyed the gameplay, 
                            the wonderful graphics and the multiplayer. The game has a wide range of 
                            characters and satisfying battle mechanics through elemental reactions.

                        <h3>Guardian Tales</h3>
                        <p class="info">
                            Guardian Tales was a game which I accidnentally stumbled upon. 
                            When I tried it, I was drawn to the story of the game as well as 
                            the cool battle system.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Arknights</h3>
                        <p class="info">
                            When I 1st tried Arknights I was not really into the game and 
                            played it very casually joining on and off on occasions.
                            Eventually I got into the game as it has built a very realistic 
                            feel for its players when it came to the story as well as the 
                            very interesting tower defence style.

                        <h3>Grand Summoners</h3>
                        <p class="info">
                            Grand Summoners is a game which I played out of interest due to the 
                            crossover of my favourite anime and I played it ever since. The game 
                            has a good number of characters with wonderful pixel art and cool 
                            characters and bosses.

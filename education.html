                        During my primary school years, I went to Nan Chiau Primary School and 
                        I spent my time wondering what I would want to do in the future while 
                        hanging out with friends, playing sports like badminton and mobile games.

                        Recommended by my neighbour who went to Pei Hwa Secondary School, I went with it
                        and joined the Normal Academic stream. I was still lost on what I want to do until 
                        I was in my forth year where I realised that I could just be a game developer which 
                        became my goal.
